# DNN---CIFAR10

I am creating a fully-connected deep neural network in Python from scratch. The network was trained on the CIFAR10 dataset and learned to classify images into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

cifar10-hw1 contains folders for train and test images. There are 50, 000 labeled train images and 10, 000 unlabeled test images.
